# Debrief: API Refactoring

- **Source Brief**: `brief-03-proposed-api-spec.md`
- **Date**: 2025-08-17

## Accomplishments

1.  **API Design**: Specified a new class-based API (`SimpleGraph`) to provide a clean, modern, and extensible interface for the library.
2.  **Core Class Implementation**: Implemented the core `SimpleGraph` class with a static `connect` method, unifying the database connection and initialization process.
3.  **Modular API**: Created a modular API with dedicated manager classes (`NodeManager`, `EdgeManager`, `QueryManager`, `VisualizationManager`) to logically group related functionalities.
4.  **Feature Migration**: Successfully migrated all existing database and visualization functions from the old, flat API structure to the new class-based API.
5.  **New Features**: Implemented several new features as part of the refactor, including `update` methods for nodes and edges, and a `raw` query method for direct, read-only SQL execution.
6.  **Comprehensive Codebase Refactoring**: Updated all tests and relevant scripts to use the new `SimpleGraph` API, ensuring the entire codebase is consistent with the new design.
7.  **Deprecation & Cleanup**: Deprecated and removed the old, unused functions from `operations.ts` and `connection.ts`, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

## Problems Encountered

1.  **`replace` Tool Brittleness**: The `replace` tool failed multiple times due to subtle differences in line endings (`\n` vs. `\r\n`) between the provided string and the actual file content. This necessitated a switch to a more robust read-modify-write strategy for file modifications.

## Lessons Learned

1.  **Robust File Writing Strategy**: For complex, multi-line text replacement, a read-modify-write strategy (`read_file` -> modify content -> `write_file`) is significantly more reliable than using the `replace` tool with a large `old_string`. This approach avoids hard-to-debug issues with line endings, whitespace, and other subtle character mismatches.
2.  **Checklists for Large Tasks**: Using a checklist for large-scale refactoring is crucial. It provides a clear roadmap, helps in tracking progress, and ensures that all required tasks are completed systematically.
3.  **Value of API Design**: Investing time in designing a clean, class-based API with clear namespaces pays dividends in terms of code readability, usability, and long-term maintainability.
