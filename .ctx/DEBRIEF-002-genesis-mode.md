# Debrief: Implementation of Genesis Node

- **Source Brief**: `brief-02-implement-genesis-node`
- **Date**: 2025-08-17

## Accomplishments

1.  **Schema Modification**: Successfully updated `src/database/schema.ts` to automatically insert the genesis node (`id: '0'`) into every new database upon initialization.
2.  **Deletion Protection**: Implemented immutability for the genesis node by creating a `deleteNode` function in `src/database/operations.ts` that throws an error if deletion of node `'0'` is attempted.
3.  **Verification Tests**: Authored a new test suite in `tests/unit/database-operations.test.ts` to validate both the successful creation of the genesis node and its protection from deletion.
4.  **Database Migration**: Executed a migration script to insert the genesis node into all existing `.db` files within the project, ensuring consistency across all databases.

## Problems Encountered

1.  **Environment Mismatch (Shell)**: The initial migration attempt using a shell script failed because it used `chmod`, a Linux/macOS command, which is not available in the Windows environment.
2.  **Missing Dependency (Shell)**: The second shell script attempt failed with a `command not found` error, indicating that the `sqlite3` command-line tool was not available in the execution environment.
3.  **Module System Conflict (Node.js)**: The first Node.js migration script failed because it used CommonJS `require()` syntax in a project configured for ES Modules (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`).

## Lessons Learned

1.  **Environment is Key**: Always confirm the target OS and environment before using shell commands. What works in one environment may not work in another.
2.  **Use Project Dependencies**: For portability and reliability, it's better to use libraries included in the project's `package.json` (like the `sqlite3` npm package) rather than relying on globally installed command-line tools.
3.  **Check `package.json` for Module Type**: Before writing Node.js scripts, check `package.json` for `"type": "module"` to determine whether to use ES Module (`import`) or CommonJS (`require`) syntax. Using the `.cjs` extension is a reliable way to ensure a script is treated as CommonJS.
