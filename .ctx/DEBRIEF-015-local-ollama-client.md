# DEBRIEF: Local Ollama Client Implementation (Brief 15)

## Accomplishments

- Designed and implemented a type-safe `OllamaClient` class for local LLM interaction.
- Supported both single-shot text generation and multi-turn chat via Ollama API endpoints.
- Created robust TypeScript interfaces for all API payloads and responses.
- Developed integration tests for both generate and chat methods, including a dialog session that persists output to a file.
- Ensured type safety (`bun tsc --noEmit`) and verified targeted tests pass.
- Debugged and resolved streaming JSON response handling for Ollama endpoints.

## Problems Encountered

- Initial failures due to incorrect handling of streaming JSON responses from Ollama (multiple JSON objects per line).
- Unrelated test failures (e.g., graph-pipeline-bun-test) when running the full test suite.
- Dialog output was initially written to the project root instead of the test folder.

## Lessons Learned

- Ollama API endpoints stream JSON objects, requiring line-by-line parsing and content aggregation.
- Only run targeted tests for new functionality to avoid confusion from unrelated failures; circle back to full suite after core features are validated.
- Persisting test artifacts (like dialog logs) in the test folder improves organization and traceability.
- Printing raw server responses is invaluable for debugging API integration issues.

## Next Steps

- Integrate OllamaClient into higher-level features (semantic validation, enrichment, etc.).
- Expand dialog and chat tests for more complex scenarios.
- Revisit and resolve unrelated test failures as needed.
