- in the website we need to show different numbers in the dashboard section
- we want to see counts of directives, neologisms, heuristics, connections, categories, tags, etc- many of the Drenered DOT graphs do not look good
- we should reduce the graphs down to the ones that CTX requires
- 
- the SVG file links need fixed up
- is there a native DOT viewer, say an npm package
- when we view the PNG images we cannot see the whole image
