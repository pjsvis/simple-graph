- ok, the way we have developed the project so far is as follows:
- we had some SQL and we developed a set of tests to convert the sql to javascript functions
- we then ported most of these functions to an API
- we still have a number of test that do not correspond to functionality in the API
- we should 1. identify the test files involved
- next we should extract the sql from these test files and convert them to parametrised functions
- then we should add these fucntions to the API
- opinion and a chekcklisted plan would be appreciated
