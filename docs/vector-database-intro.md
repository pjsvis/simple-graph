# Introduction to Vector Databases & Embeddings

A vector database is a system designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors—numerical representations of data such as text, images, or audio. In modern AI, these vectors (embeddings) capture the semantic meaning of data, enabling powerful similarity search and recommendations.

## Why Use a Vector Database?

- **Semantic Search**: Find conceptually similar items, not just exact matches.
- **Recommendations**: Suggest related content based on meaning, not keywords.
- **Hybrid Workflows**: Combine fuzzy semantic search with precise graph traversal for richer results.

## Example: Semantic Search in Knowledge Graphs

Imagine you want to find all directives or concepts related to "collaboration"—even if they use different words. With embeddings, you can:

1. **Generate Embeddings**: Use a transformer model to convert text (e.g., directive descriptions) into vectors.
2. **Store Vectors**: Save these vectors in a vector database (e.g., SQLite with sqlite-vec).
3. **Similarity Search**: Search for vectors close to your query ("collaboration"), retrieving semantically related nodes.
4. **Graph Traversal**: Use the results as starting points for deeper exploration in the knowledge graph.

## How Embeddings Work

- **Embeddings** are arrays of numbers generated by AI models (like transformers) that capture the meaning of text.
- Similar meanings produce similar vectors, so you can measure semantic similarity using distance metrics (e.g., cosine similarity).

## Practical Workflow

```ts
import { Vectorizer, VectorStore } from "./vector-search";

const vectorizer = new Vectorizer();
await vectorizer.init();
const embedding = await vectorizer.embed("collaboration");

const store = new VectorStore("mydb.sqlite");
await store.init();
await store.addNodeVector("node1", "Directive about teamwork");
const results = await store.findSimilar("collaboration");
```

This workflow lets you discover hidden connections and related concepts, making your knowledge graph much smarter and more useful.
