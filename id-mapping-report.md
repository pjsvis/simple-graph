## Transformation Patterns

### CDA Metadata

- **Pattern**: Unchanged
- **Example**: `cda-61` → `cda-61`

### Directives

- **Pattern**: Add `cda-61-` prefix
- **Examples**:
  - `phi-1` → `cda-61-phi-1`
  - `opm-8` → `cda-61-opm-8`
  - `adv` → `cda-61-adv`

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Clarity**: Immediate source and version identification
2. **Namespace Safety**: Prevents ID collisions across data sources
3. **Query Efficiency**: Category-based filtering with LIKE patterns
4. **Future-Proof**: Ready for multiple CDA versions and data sources
