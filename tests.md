🚀 Enhancement Recommendations:
   1. RELATIONSHIP ENHANCEMENT:
      - Connect 63 isolated directives
      - Improve connectivity in 14 under-connected categories

   2. INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES:
      - Merge with conceptual lexicon (120+ terms)
      - Create cross-references between CDA and OH terms
      - Add semantic similarity edges

   3. SEMANTIC ENHANCEMENT:
      - Extract implicit relationships from descriptions
      - Add keyword-based connections
      - Create topic-based clustering

   4. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS:
      - Track directive evolution over CDA versions
      - Identify deprecated/superseded relationships
      - Monitor usage patterns

   5. OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION:
      - Map directives to specific OH implementations
      - Create execution dependency graphs
      - Add performance/priority metadata
