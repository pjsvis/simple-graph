# Brief: 001-mind-map-visualization

- **Docket**: simple-graph-dev
- **Title**: Implement Mind Map Visualization via DOT Language
- **Objective**: To create a capability within or alongside `simple-graph` to generate DOT language source code, which can then be rendered to produce mind-map-style visualizations of graph data.
- **Rationale**: A full, bare graph plot is often too dense for effective sense-making. A mind map provides a curated, hierarchical, and more palatable view, directly supporting **Facilitating User Sense-Making (`PHI-4`)**.
- **Key Requirements**:

1. The function should take a starting node ID and a depth parameter as input.
2. The output should be a string of valid DOT language source code.
3. The DOT graph should be configured to use card-style nodes and directed edges to create a clear, mind-map-like appearance.
4. This capability will be the primary tool used for our subsequent CDA/CL review.

- **Status**: Proposed
