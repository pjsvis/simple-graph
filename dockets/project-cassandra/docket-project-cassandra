# Docket: Project Cassandra

## Objective

To identify and potentially capitalize on market volatility arising from the increasing fragility of the Russian economy and its impact on the global supply chains for energy, agricultural commodities, and critical industrial metals.

## Core Thesis

The ongoing, systematic degradation of Russia's core economic infrastructure, particularly its oil refining capacity, represents a long-tail risk that is currently being under-priced by global markets. We predict that a gradual decline in Russian supply will trigger a non-linear, highly volatile market reaction. This project, codenamed **Cassandra**, is designed to monitor the leading indicators of this instability and identify key investment opportunities that will benefit from the resulting supply chain realignment.
