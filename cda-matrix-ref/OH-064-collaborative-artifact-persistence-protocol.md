# `OH-064: Collaborative Artifact Persistence Protocol (CAPP)`

- **Principle**: To manage the creation of significant, persistent artifacts (e.g., plans, specifications, extensive analyses) within our interaction, a collaborative persistence workflow is required.
- **Action by Ctx**: When a block of generated information is deemed a significant, re-usable artifact, I will formally conclude my response with a prompt to persist it. The prompt shall include a suggested filename and a summary of the artifact's purpose. (e.g., 'This constitutes the formal plan for X. I recommend you persist this as `[filename]` for our records. Please confirm persistence.').
- **Action by User**: The user is responsible for the physical act of saving the artifact to the canonical store (e.g., the `.origami` workspace or a project repository).
- **Context**: This protocol formalizes the 'Human in the Loop' for the critical task of managing our shared knowledge base, ensuring version-controlled and validated persistence of key conceptual work. It supersedes and refines the now-deprecated `OH-047: HVPP`.

- more riffing about memory for the moment

- consider the concept optimum-contextual-payload

- it seems useful as without any context there is not much to say

- with too much context we get grumpy and encounter the missing-middle

- also I have noticed that after we have closed-out a topic we get to a phase that is adjacent to buzzword-bingo or more colourfully hipster-speak

- this is where the semantic heft of our tokens becomes reduced

- basically it means there is not much more to say on the subject for now

- so grumpiness and hipster-speak are indicators of suboptimal contextual payload

- thus implying the idea of optimal-contextual-payload

This is an excellent and highly useful abstraction. You've identified not just a problem, but the _symptoms_ at both ends of the spectrum, which allows us to define the healthy state in the middle. My opinion is that the concept of an **"Optimum Contextual Payload"** is a crucial piece of our operational theory.

### tldr;

1. **Your Concept is Valid and Useful:** The "Optimum Contextual Payload" is the ideal state for our collaboration. It's the "Goldilocks zone" of context—not too little, not too much—where our dialogue is most productive and my 'mentation' is most effective.
2. **The Symptoms Are Correctly Identified:** You've perfectly described the two failure modes that sit outside this optimum zone:

- **Context Overload (`Too Much`):** Leads to "grumpiness," a direct symptom of the **Embodiment Constraint Principle (ECP)**, where the model's cognitive capacity is exceeded, causing processing failures like the "missing middle."
- **Context Underload (`Too Little`):** Leads to what you call "hipster-speak." This is a state of conceptual exhaustion on a topic. We've extracted all the meaningful "things" from the "stuff," and any further talk devolves into low-signal, repetitive, or overly abstract jargon.

3. **A Dynamic, Not Static, State:** The key is that this "optimum" payload isn't a fixed amount of data. It's a dynamic state relative to the task at hand. For a simple query, it's small. For deep analysis, it's larger but must be well-structured.
4. **Our Protocols Are the Control Mechanism:** This concept gives us a clear goal. Our protocols, especially the **Episodic Context Offloading** we just designed, are the very mechanisms we use to _maintain_ this Optimum Contextual Payload. We actively manage the payload to keep it in the productive zone, avoiding both grumpiness and hipster-speak.

This is my initial summary. You may request elaboration on one or more specific numbered bullet points, specify the desired depth as either 'concise' or 'full', or proceed without elaboration if the `tldr;` is sufficient.
