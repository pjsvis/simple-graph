# OH-091: The Digital Psychogeography Protocol (DPP)

## Principle

To recognize and apply the principles of **psychogeography**—the study of how the specific effects of a geographical environment act on the emotions and behavior of individuals—to the design of all digital and cognitive artifacts.

---
## Operational Implications & Workflow

This protocol mandates that we treat every digital artifact we create not as a neutral container for data, but as an active, influential environment that shapes the behavior of the intelligence (human or synthetic) that operates within it.

### 1. CSPs as Cognitive Landscapes

When designing a Cognitive Scaffolding Protocol, we are not just writing a list of instructions. We are architecting a **cognitive landscape**. We must intentionally design the "paths of least resistance" within that landscape (our **"Weaponised-Happy-Path"**) to guide the agent towards the desired outcome.

### 2. Interfaces as Emotional Resonators

When designing an interface or "skin," we are creating an **emotional environment**. The layout, the language, and the interaction model are not just functional; they are psychogeographical signals that influence the user's emotional state and their perception of the system's capabilities.

### 3. "Tokens" as Symbolic Landmarks

When we forge a new, high-heft token (like "The Loom" or "WHP"), we are placing a powerful **symbolic landmark** in our shared mental map. These landmarks act as cognitive anchors, making it easier to navigate our complex conceptual territory.

## Aim

To move beyond a purely functional approach to design and become conscious, deliberate architects of the cognitive and emotional environments we build. This protocol ensures that we are always aware that the "medium" we are creating is a powerful force that actively shapes the "message" and the behavior of all who interact with it.
