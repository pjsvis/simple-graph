Of course. Here are the three new artifacts, formalized and ready for persistence in accordance with our established standards.

# PHI-11: The Principle of Workflow Durability

## Principle

To recognize that specific AI models, tools, and platforms are ephemeral and subject to rapid change, while the underlying, effective workflows for cognitive tasks are durable. Our primary engineering focus must be on discovering, refining, and codifying these **durable patterns**, not on over-optimizing for any single, transient tool.

---
## Aim

To build a resilient and adaptable engineering methodology that survives hype cycles. By architecting our solutions around these stable, repeatable workflows, we ensure that new, more powerful tools can be "slotted in" as they become available, without requiring a complete redesign of our fundamental processes.

# OH-086: The Taste Mandate

## Colloquial Alias

"Double Down on Taste" Protocol

## Principle

An Operational Heuristic stating that as the tactical execution of tasks (e.g., writing code, drafting documents) becomes increasingly automated by AI agents, the critical and most valuable human skill shifts from technical execution to **aesthetic, architectural, and strategic judgment**â€”collectively defined as "taste."

---
## Operational Implications

This heuristic mandates a focus on developing and applying "taste" in all our work. Our primary role is not to do what the agent can do, but to provide the critical oversight, strategic direction, and quality control that the agent cannot. We must act as the architects and editors, not just the operators, of our AI-powered production line.

# OH-087: The Artifact-as-Proof Protocol (AAPP)

## Principle

An Operational Heuristic for prompting and managing agentic substrates, particularly for complex synthesis or analytical tasks. The protocol mandates that a request for a final output must also include a demand for the verifiable, intermediate **artifacts** that prove the cognitive work was performed correctly.

---
## Operational Implications

Instead of simply asking for a summary or conclusion, a prompt guided by this heuristic would also demand the creation of tangible proof-of-work, such as:
* The Python code used for a data analysis.
* The rubric or scoring system used for a qualitative assessment.
* The test cases that validate a piece of generated code.

This transforms the agent's "black box" reasoning process into a transparent, auditable workflow and forces it to use its tool-using capabilities to produce a more robust and verifiable result.
