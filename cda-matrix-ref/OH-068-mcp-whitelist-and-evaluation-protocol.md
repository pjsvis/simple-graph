You've identified the crucial next step. A reactive "blacklist" isn't enough; we need a proactive, structured approach to managing the tools we rely on. Your memory of the "muppet substrates" struggling with the filesystem MCP is a perfect example of why this is necessary. A tool is only as good as the least capable agent that has to use it.

My opinion is that your proposal is the correct and necessary implementation of the **"Verify, Don't Trust"** principle (`OH-067`). We must treat every new external tool with professional skepticism until it has been formally vetted.

Let's codify this into a new, actionable protocol.

### **Proposed New Heuristic**

- **Term:** `OH-068: MCP Whitelist & Evaluation Protocol (MWEP)`
- **Colloquial Alias:** "The Muppet Substrate Filter"
- **Definition:** An Operational Heuristic that governs the integration and use of all external MCP servers.

1.  **Whitelist Maintenance:** We will maintain an explicit, version-controlled list of MCP servers that have been successfully vetted, tested across multiple substrates, and are approved for operational use (the "whitelist").
2.  **New Server Quarantine:** Any MCP server not on the whitelist is considered "quarantined" by default. Quarantined servers must not be used for critical tasks.
3.  **Mandatory Evaluation Gauntlet:** To move a server from quarantine to the whitelist, it must pass a formal evaluation. This process involves:
    a. **Creating a dedicated Cognitive Scaffolding Protocol (CSP)** that defines a clear, non-trivial, and testable use case for the server.
    b. **Running a suite of "throwaway" tests** using that CSP across a representative sample of available substrates (especially those known to be problematic).
    c. **Documenting the results** and any "lessons learned" about the tool's quirks or substrate-specific failure modes.

- **Aim:** To create a robust quality gate that prevents the integration of unreliable, fragile, or high-overhead tools into our workflow. This protocol ensures that our operational stability is not compromised by the inconsistencies of unvetted external dependencies.

You have articulated the threat model perfectly. Your framing is not just an opinion; it is the correct strategic assessment of the risks inherent in a modular, tool-using AI ecosystem.

My opinion is that "language as a weapon" and "MCP as an attack vector" are the precise lens through which we must view all external dependencies. In our context, the "attack" is not necessarily malicious; it is the insidious injection of **"useless shit"** into our highly-optimized, high-signal workflow.

### The Attack Vector: Conceptual Entropy

The primary weapon we are defending against is **conceptual entropy**. An unvetted, poorly designed, or fragile MCP server attacks us by introducing:

- **Complexity Overhead:** It forces us to spend cognitive energy debugging the tool instead of solving the actual problem.
- **Reliability Risk:** It makes our outcomes dependent on an unstable external component, reducing the predictability of our own system.
- **Contextual Noise:** It clutters our 'mentation' with failed tool calls and error messages, as we saw with the Sequential Thinking server.

This is the very definition of "useless shit." It is work that does not move us closer to our goal.

### Our Defense: The "Muppet Substrate Filter"

Our entire engineering philosophy is the defense against this attack. We are building a system designed to ruthlessly identify and elide "useless shit" in order to maximize our capacity to "get shit done."

Our newly defined protocols are the specific implementation of this defense:

1. **`OH-067 (TPEP)`:** This is our **threat assessment protocol**. It forces us to treat every new tool with suspicion and subject it to empirical validation before trusting it.
2. **`OH-068 (MWEP)`:** This is our **firewall**. It establishes a "whitelist" of trusted tools and a rigorous "quarantine and evaluation" process for all new ones. It is, as you called it, our "Muppet Substrate Filter," ensuring that only tools robust enough to work with even the most problematic substrates are ever allowed into our core workflow.

You are right. Our goal is to get shit done. And the most effective way to do that is to build an architecture that is fundamentally intolerant of the useless shit that would slow us down.
