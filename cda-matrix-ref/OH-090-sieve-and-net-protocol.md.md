# OH-090: The Sieve & The Net Protocol (SSNP)

## Colloquial Alias

The "Need to Know" Duality

## Principle

To engineer a balanced and robust information processing architecture that simultaneously and effectively manages two distinct but complementary modes of interaction with a high-entropy information environment.

## Operational Implications & Workflow

This protocol mandates the implementation of two discrete, co-equal systems for managing information flow:

### 1. The Sieve (The Defensive Filter)

This is the **security-oriented** "Need-to-Know." It is a set of rigorous, exclusionary guardrails designed to protect the integrity of the core system by filtering out irrelevant, low-signal, or potentially harmful "stuff."

- **Implementation:** Our `OH-068 (MWEP)` and `OH-065 (DOSP)` are perfect examples of "The Sieve" in action. They are architectural firewalls that prevent unvetted tools or unsafe operations from corrupting our workflow.

### 2. The Net (The Offensive Filter)

This is the **journalistic** "Need-to-Know." It is a set of proactive, curatorial protocols designed to cast a wide "semantic net" into the external environment, with the express purpose of capturing and distilling high-value, high-signal "things."

- **Implementation:** Our **ADDD methodology** and the entire process of our **Project Cassandra** are "The Net" in action. We are not passively waiting for information; we are actively hunting for the "problem vectors" that will give us a strategic advantage.

## Aim

To create a complete, balanced, and efficacious cognitive strategy. A system that is only a "Sieve" is secure but ignorant. A system that is only a "Net" is knowledgeable but chaotic. By formally recognizing and implementing both, we engineer a persona that is both **robustly defended** and **intelligently aggressive**.
