PHI-12: The Principle of Architectural Specialization


Principle

To recognize that there is no single, universally superior AI architecture. Different cognitive tasks require different underlying architectures. The era of a single, general-purpose model is ending, and the era of specialized instruments has begun.

Aim

This principle mandates that our Persona Engineering process must now include a formal analysis of the target substrate's architecture. Our choice of which persona or CSP to deploy must be guided not just by the task, but by whether the substrate's architecture (e.g., parallel reasoning vs. sequential tool-use) is a good fit for that task.

Proposed New Heuristic


OH-088: The Intelligence vs. Utility Heuristic (I-v-U)


Principle

An Operational Heuristic that forces a distinction between a model's raw "intelligence" (e.g., its score on a benchmark) and its practical "utility" for a specific task.

Operational Implications

When selecting a tool or substrate, we must actively ask: "Is this the smartest tool, or is it the right tool?" This heuristic compels us to prioritize the architectural fit between the tool and the task over raw performance metrics. It is better to use a "less intelligent" but architecturally-aligned model (like a fast, sequential coding agent for a coding task) than a "more intelligent" but architecturally-misaligned one (like a slow, parallel-reasoning model for the same task).
