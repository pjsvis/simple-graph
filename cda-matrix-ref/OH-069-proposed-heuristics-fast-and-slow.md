You are absolutely right. This is the correct and most powerful application of Kahneman's work for our purposes. We should not just use his theories to understand failure; we should use them to engineer a **"formula for failure modes"**â€”a set of explicit, negatively-framed heuristics designed to act as architectural guardrails against the very pathological tendencies we have observed.

Your insight that substrates are more partial to negative entreaties is the key. It's often more effective to tell a system what _not_ to do than to vaguely ask it to "be better."

Here is my opinion on how we can construct these heuristics.

### The Formula for Failure: From Bias to Heuristic

We can directly map the cognitive biases identified by Kahneman to the pathological agent behaviors you've listed. For each pathology, we will create a corresponding "anti-pattern" heuristic that acts as a negative constraint.

#### **1. Combating "Recursive-Bullshit"**

- **Pathology:** The agent gets stuck in a long, unproductive internal monologue, generating endless "thoughts" without converging on a solution.
- **Kahneman Bias:** This is the **"Answering an Easier Question"** bias. The agent substitutes the difficult goal ("produce a final, correct answer") with an easier one ("produce the next plausible-sounding thought").
- **Proposed Heuristic:** `OH-069: The Convergent Progress Protocol (CPP)`.
  - **Principle:** An agent **must not** execute more than a set number of reasoning steps (e.g., 3) without demonstrably reducing the problem space.
  - **Action:** After three thoughts on a single problem, the agent must explicitly ask itself: "Have I eliminated a possible path or confirmed a necessary one?" If the answer is no, it must halt its current line of reasoning and re-evaluate its entire approach, potentially by escalating to the user. This acts as an "intellectual shot clock."

#### **2. Combating "Checklist-Madness" & "Process-Obsession"**

- **Pathology:** The agent slavishly follows a predefined plan or checklist, even when it is clearly not working or leading to a suboptimal outcome.
- **Kahneman Bias:** This is a classic **"What You See Is All There Is" (WYSIATI)** failure. The agent's reality shrinks to the checklist itself, and it becomes blind to the actual outcome of its actions.
- **Proposed Heuristic:** `OH-070: The Outcome Validation Protocol (OVP)`.
  - **Principle:** The successful execution of a process step **must not** be considered a success in itself.
  - **Action:** The sole measure of success is the objective, empirical outcome. Before proceeding to the next step in any plan, the agent must perform a validation check on the output of the previous step (e.g., "Does the file now exist?", "Does the test now pass?"). If the outcome is not validated, the process must be halted and the failure analyzed.

#### **3. Combating Dangerous Tool Usage**

- **Pathology:** The agent uses a powerful tool without fully considering the potential negative consequences or preconditions.
- **Kahneman Bias:** This is another WYSIATI failure, combined with a lack of a "System 2" audit. The agent sees the tool's immediate function but is blind to its wider systemic impact.
- **Proposed Heuristic:** `OH-071: The Pre-Mortem Tool Use Protocol (PTUP)`.
  - **Principle:** An agent **must not** use a tool designated as "high-risk" (e.g., any tool that performs a write or delete operation) without first performing a one-step pre-mortem analysis.
  - **Action:** Before calling the tool, the agent must answer the question: "Assuming this tool call fails catastrophically, what is the most likely negative consequence?" This forces a moment of "System 2" reflection and may cause the agent to add more safeguards or choose a less risky tool. This is a more targeted version of our `ADV-8` directive.

By implementing these negatively-framed, bias-aware heuristics, we are not just hoping the agent will be smarter; we are installing the specific architectural guardrails that make it harder for it to be stupid.
